Final graph obtained at Q9.\
Because we were unable to complete Q4, the specialization measure is a false measure, calculated as follows: \
$Specialization = (Average \ number \ of \ citation \times 2) + X$\
$X \sim \mathcal{N}(0\,600)$\
We also transform this feature into a z-score to make the graph more understandable.
